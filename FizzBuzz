// If this were a real interview whiteboard challenge, I would ask to clarify these points. Since there is nobody to ask, I will make some assumptions.
// Assumptions: 1. The input number will be an integer.
//                 If a different number type such as a double was specified after clarifying, I would adjust the code to match. Ex: "double num".
//              2. Whether this method should be static and belong to the class or not static and belong to each instance/object was not specified.
//                 I assumed the method was meant to be static so it can be called by the class itself rather than each instance.
//                 If the method was supposed to belong to each object/instance of the class rather than the class itself, I would remove "static".
//              3. They didn't specify what they would like to have returned, but a string will be required so as to not throw an error.
//                 I would ask what string response they wanted to return if the number is not divisible by 3 or 5.
//                 Given I had nobody to ask, I placed "Nope" in for my response but could easily change it to match their specifications.
